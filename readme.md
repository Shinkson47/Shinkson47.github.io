# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

A portfolio website for myself intended for the proffessional environment surrounding my career, particularly potential employers. 

The site contains a basic portfolio linking to some publically available projects in a portfolio page, a page with non-work related information about myself as a person, a form to get in contact with me, and a landing page.


I went with a tech-ie theme which is a subgenre known as `cyberpunk`, with other technical elements such as the terminal. Given the line of work, the technical elements *should* appeal to viewers. A library helped achieve this appearance, which will be apparent as you read the source; CSS contains `--aug-...` styles and the HTML contains `data-augmented-ui` attributes which style and shape borders of elements.

The navigation bar collapses on small screens, and content will center with less bordering in order to appear accessably on smaller screens.
